								If you've found an object with a stkr.link and you think its owner might have lost or forgotten it, then you've come to the right place.

							<span class="image main"><img src="images/jonas-leupe-0IVop5v4MMU-unsplash.jpg" alt="Unsplash photo of person holding smartphone next to NFC device" /></span>
							<p>
								Simply scan the stkr.link with an NFC-capable phone, and see what it shows! It might give you the owner's name, phone number, email, Twitter, or something else. Then, you can contact the owner and help them get this item back. That's an awesome thing to do!

								<strong><i class="icon solid fa-exclamation-triangle"><span class="label">Warning</span></i> Beware!</strong>

								Anyone can create a stkr.link with anything they want on it, including scams or other malicious content. Please use your judgment to determine whether it's safe to make use of the information on the stkr.link.

							<h2>How do I scan a stkr.link?</h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>First, you should check if your device supports NFC. If it does not, then please ask someone else to scan the stkr.link. If you aren't sure, you can still try scanning the sticker.</p>
							<h3>Android devices</h3>
							<p>
								If you have an Android device, you may be able to simply unlock it and scan the stkr.link. Depending on the data on the stkr.link, it might show some text or open your text messaging app to send a text to the owner.
							</p>
							<p>
								You can also download an NFC app to inspect the stkr.link in detail. <strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wakdev.wdnfc" target="_blank">NFC Tools</a></strong> is a great choice, as is <strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nxp.taginfolite" target="_blank">NXP's TagInfo</a></strong>.
							</p>
							<h3>iOS devices</h3>
							<p>
								You will need to use an NFC app to see the contents of the stkr.link. <strong><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nfc-taginfo-by-nxp/id1246143596" target="_blank">NXP's TagInfo</a></strong> should work well for this.
							</p>
							<h3>What if something seems... iffy?</h3>
							<p>
								If you are uncomfortable for whatever reason, then you do not have to do anything. You do not have to scan any stkr.link, and if you did scan one, you do not have to do anything with the information on it. Remember, anyone could put an NFC sticker on anything and write any information they like on it.

										<h3>Buying NFC stickers</h3>
										<p>There are a lot of options, but choose wisely!</p>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<p>
											NFC technology is widely used for many different purposes. Unfortunately, this means that there are many choices and little explanation of what they mean.
										</p>
										<p>
											If you want a quick and easy answer that works for most people, get NTAG215 stickers, like <strong><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B071ZZTT6T" target="_blank">this set</a></strong> or <strong><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07MKWHYQK" target="_blank">this set</a></strong>.
										</p>
										<p>
											Note, if you want to place these NFC stickers on metal surfaces, you will most likely need to use "anti-metal" NFC stickers instead, like <strong><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B086W5N6R7" target="_blank">this set</a></strong> or <strong><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B09536MQGY" target="_blank">this set</a></strong>, because they have a ferrite layer that lets NFC work correctly around metal.
										</p>
										<p>
											Many other options are out there, but NTAG215 should work in most situations, and these stickers are fairly easy to find. They have 504 bytes of writable memory. For comparison, NTAG213 supports 144 bytes, while NTAG216 supports 888 bytes. Other tag types exist as well, such as MIFARE Classic and Topaz 512, but the NTAG series is currently the most popular and well-supported for general purpose information storage.

										<h3>Labeling your stkr.link</h3>
										<p>How do people know what to do if they find a stkr.link?</p>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<p>
											If someone finds a blank NFC sticker, their first reaction might not be to open up their phone's NFC app and scan it. So, you can stamp the sticker or write something useful on it, like "Property of John Smith / stkr.link". Please <strong>avoid ballpoint pens</strong>, because they can damage NFC electronics if you use a lot of force.
										</p>
										<p>
											A custom stamp with writing or image of your choice can be surprisingly affordable. Since the stickers are small, the stamp should be even smaller. For example, here is a <strong><a href="https://smile.amazon.com/dp/B07KYX8S6K" target="_blank">self-inking 3/4&quot; one</a></strong>.
											<br />
											You can use <a href="images/stkr.link-large.png" target="_blank">the stkr.link logo</a> or anything else you like. Linking to this website might help people to understand what to do if they find such an NFC sticker, but that's entirely optional.
										</p>
										<p>
											If you don't want to use a stamp, then a permanent marker should work well. Be sure to use one with a fine enough point that you can legibly write your message.
										</p>
									</div>

										<h3>Programming your stkr.link</h3>
										<p>What would you like people to do if they find something of yours with a stkr.link?</p>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<p>
											You can program a stkr.link to show a message, open a URL, initiate a phone call, write a text message, begin creating an email, and many other things. But don't overcomplicate matters. There is limited space available (see above), and besides, you should make it easy for someone to contact you if they've found something of yours.
											<br />
											For example, you can make your stkr.link initiate a text message to your phone number with the pre-written message "Hi John, I found something that might belong to you".
										</p>
										<p>
											To do this, you'll need to use an NFC writing app. On Android, <strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wakdev.wdnfc" target="_blank">NFC Tools</a></strong> works well. Alternatively, NXP's TagWriter is available for both <strong><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nxp.nfc.tagwriter" target="_blank">Android</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/nfc-tagwriter-by-nxp/id1246143221" target="_blank">iOS</a></strong>.
										</p>
										<p>
											If you want to prevent your stkr.link from being edited later, NTAG stickers support "locking", or setting a read-only flag. You can do this using the NFC writing app of your choice. Note, you will not be able to make any further changes to the stkr.link afterward.
